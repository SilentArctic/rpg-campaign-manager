1. Before staring any work, assign yourself to an issue so I know what's being worked on. If there are no issues for what you want to work on, create one.
2. Please use **3 spaces** for indenting.
3. I am not a UI/UX designer by any stretch of the imagination. If you think you can make something look better (and you probably can), I won't be offended.
4. [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/react-jss/?v=v10.8.0) and scss is supported. JSS is preferred, but scss is fine if you don't want to learn JSS.
5. Don't add any new packages without prior approval.
6. It is recommended for contributors to have had a some experience with Table Top Role Playing Games (TTRPGs) such as Dungeons and Dragons, but not required.
